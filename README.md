# RedirectToBlock
A chrome extension for blocking unproductive sites by redirecting you to your whitelisted sites.

##Features I plan to implement:
1. Redirects from a block site. Either one link or list of links. 
2. Catagories for redirects.
3. Saved settings for redirect lists: 
  * For instance, programing practice links can all be in one saved setting. When ever you add a site for redirect you can access a drop down menu and get your saved setting. Or create another setting. 
4. Whitelist sites rather than blacklist.
  * You will also be able to make your whitelist a saved setting for redirects.
5. Chose how the chrome extension will rotate your links. 
  * Refreshing will randomly select another website.
  * Manual selct a website all the time.
  * Manually select from random website that was redirected if you don't want the current site you are on. 
  * If no links than the site will just be blocked and take you to your block settings page (with ability to emergency whitelist the application especially if on only whitelisted sites mode but not allow you to do it if in no excuses mode).
  * Cycle through website lists in order manually or through refresh.
6. Ability to add a no excuses option to the chrome extension that will not allow you to change the settings so you can get to a blocked website. (Not sure how I'm going to do that one yet)
7. Have an account and password but also allow you to just be a guest and have your settings saved in the browser.
